        "- The __del__() method in Python is a special (dunder) method called when an object is about to be destroyed, i.e., just before it is garbage collected.\n",
        "- Purpose of __del__():\n",
        "  1. Destructor Method\n",
        "    - Acts as a destructor — the opposite of __init__().\n",
        "    - Cleans up resources like open files, network connections, or database cursors.\n",
        "  2. Automatically Invoked\n",
        "    - Called automatically when an object’s reference count drops to zero.\n",
        "    - Useful for final cleanup logic before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "  3. Not Commonly Needed\n",
        "    - Python uses a garbage collector, so manual cleanup via __del__() is rarely necessary.\n",
        "    - Prefer using with statements (context managers) for managing resources safely.\n",
        "- Important Notes:\n",
        "  - __del__() is not guaranteed to be called immediately after del.\n",
        "  - If there are circular references, the object may not be deleted right away.\n",
        "  - Exceptions in __del__() are ignored silently, which can hide bugs.\n",
        "- Best Practices:\n",
        "  - Use __del__() only when truly needed for cleanup.\n",
        "  - If you need more control, use __enter__ and __exit__ with context managers."

        "- Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes (that share a common parent) to be treated the same way, while still behaving differently depending on their actual class.\n",
        "- Key Concept:\n",
        "  - With inheritance, a child class overrides a method from the parent class.\n",
        "  - When you call the method on a parent-type reference, Python automatically runs the child’s version if applicable.\n",
        "  - This is known as runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "- How It Works – Bullet Points\n",
        "  1. Inheritance Relationship\n",
        "    - Multiple classes inherit from the same base (parent) class.\n",
        "    - They override the same method (same name, different behavior).\n",
        "  2. Same Interface, Different Behavior\n",
        "    - A common method (e.g., speak()) is called on different objects.\n",
        "    - Each object responds in its own way, based on its class.\n",
        "  3. Flexible Function Calls\n",
        "    - Functions or loops can work with any subclass object using the parent class type.\n",
